              You are the Light of the World’is the motto of Christ school. It is taken from the Holy Bible Mathew 5:14. Imbibing this spirit, Christ School concentrates on the integral growth and total formation of the human person by leading the life in a righteous path. Light cannot be sordid. We make the students to apprehend that they are the light of the world and they must live uprightly to reveal the love of God. Let the light sparkle before others by doing good deeds essential to the well-being of the world.
